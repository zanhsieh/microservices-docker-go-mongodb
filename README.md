# Cinema - Example of Microservices in Go with Docker and MongoDB

This is a test.


Overview
========

Cinema is an example project which demonstrates the use of microservices for a fictional movie theater.
The Cinema backend is powered by 4 microservices, all of witch happen to be written in Go, using MongoDB for manage the database and Docker to isolate and deploy the ecosystem.

 * Movie Service: Provides information like movie ratings, title, etc.
 * Show Times Service: Provides show times information.
 * Booking Service: Provides booking information. 
 * Users Service: Provides movie suggestions for users by communicating with other services.

The Cinema use case is based on the project written in Python by [Umer Mansoor](https://github.com/umermansoor/microservices).

The proyect structure is based in the knowledge learned in the book: Web
Development with Go by Shiju Varghese, ISBN 978-1-4842-1053-6

Requirements
===========

* Docker 1.12
* Docker Compose 1.8

We must **add virtual domains** in order to use each **api entry point**. By default we are using: **movies.local**, **bookings.local**, **users.local** and **showtimes.local**

**Virtual domains** has been defined in `docker-compose.yml` file and configured in `/etc/hosts` file. Add the following line in your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1   movies.local bookings.local users.local showtimes.local
```

Starting services
==============================

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Stoping services
==============================

```
docker-compose stop
```

Including new changes
==============================

If you need change some source code you can deploy it typing:

```
docker-compose build
```

Restore database information
======================

You can start using an empty database for all microservices, but if you want you can restore a preconfigured data following this steps:

**_Access to mongodb container typing:_**

```
docker exec -it cinema-db /bin/bash
```

**_Restore data typing:_**

```
/backup/restore.sh
```

**_Leave the container:_**

```
exit
```
